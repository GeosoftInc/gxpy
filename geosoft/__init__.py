gxapi.GXCancel.__doc__ = '''
A subclass of `SystemExit <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit>`_ which is raised when a 
script should cleanly exit due to a cancellation condition. Generally not caught since it will have the same effect 
as :exc:`SystemExit` for both standalone and Oasis montaj extension scripts. Raised from within API by 
:func:`geosoft.gxapi.GXSYS.cancel()`

gxapi.GXAPIError.__doc__ = '''
   A subclass of `RuntimeError <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError>`_ which is raised whenever 
   the GX Python API encounters initialization issues or other API violations. It generally indicates a bug in Python code.

gxapi.GXError.__doc__ = '''
A subclass of `RuntimeError <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError>`_ which is raised whenever 
a GX Python API call encounters an error. Often the message string of these errors are informative to the user (e.g. File 
'x' is locked in another application) but there could be cases where this is not the case. In most cases an attribute, 
:attr:`number`, is also available on the exception object that matches the number in the :code:`geosoft.ger` file.
These numbers instead of the string (which could change or even be translated) should be used to identify and handle
very specific exceptions.
